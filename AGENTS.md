# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` contains the React Router v7 full-stack app.
  - `app/routes/` holds route modules (public, auth, editor, admin).
  - `app/lib/` hosts server utilities (auth, Supabase client, tournament logic, types).
  - `app/components/` contains shared UI (e.g., `Header.tsx`).
  - `app/app.css` defines global styles and CSS variables.
- `public/` stores static assets (e.g., `favicon.ico`).
- `supabase/schema.sql` defines the database schema and RLS policies.
- `build/` is the production output generated by `npm run build`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server with HMR (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build     # Create production build in build/
npm run start     # Serve production build
npm run typecheck # Generate React Router types and run TypeScript checks
```

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript + React Router v7 (ESM).
- Indentation: 2 spaces in TS/TSX and CSS.
- Imports: use the `~/` alias for `app/` (example: `import { getUser } from "~/lib/auth.server";`).
- Styling: plain CSS with variables and `prefers-color-scheme` for dark mode.
- File naming: route files follow React Router conventions (e.g., `player.$id.tsx`).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test framework is configured yet.
- Use `npm run typecheck` as the minimum verification step before changes.
- If you add tests later, document the framework and naming patterns here.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages in history are short, imperative, and scoped to a single change (examples: “Add export results”, “Update styles”).
- PRs should include:
  - A concise summary of the change and affected areas.
  - Any relevant screenshots for UI updates.
  - Notes on schema changes if `supabase/schema.sql` is modified.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Set `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your environment for local runs.
- Avoid committing secrets; keep credentials in local env files or your shell.
